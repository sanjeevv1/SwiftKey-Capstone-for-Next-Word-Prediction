# SwiftKey-Capstone-for-Next-Word-Prediction
This repo contains the code for the Next Word Prediction Shiny app which was written for the Capstone Project in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University. This project was done in conjunction with SwiftKey.
The languageModel.R file contains the stand alone code that creates the language model matrices.
These are then loaded separately in Shiny app at run time. The Shiny app then executes the next word prediction
based on the user's input.
